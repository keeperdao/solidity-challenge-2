# KD UniV3 Challenge

This is the second Solidity development challenge created for KeeperDAO Labs.

## Challenge:

Create a smart contract in Solidity which allows a user to swap against [UniswapV3Pool.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol), without paying for gas. Create a function to calculate the price off-chain, and the calculated price should be used to trade against the uniswap pool contract. For this challenge you do not have to think about making the trader pay for gas. Build this using hardhat and create a testsuite to test your newly created contract against UniswapV3 mainnet deployment.
